Jupyter Notebooks have support for three different programming languages: Julia, Python, and R (which gives it the name Ju-Pyt-R). Julia is a popular scientific programming language, and R is popular in statistics and data science.\n","\n","Out of the three languages, though, Python is the most popular. It's a major component in almost all software that you will encounter, e.g. Google, Youtube, Facebook, Instagram, Reddit, and Uber all have Python in their codebase. This is one of the reasons why we're using it in our notebooks.\n","\n","Python provides basic functionality for getting things done. We saw some of this functionality last time: we saw how `if` statements could be used to control the \"logical flow\" of a program, we saw how `for` loops could be used to iterate operations, and we saw how `functions` could be used as a template for performing a specific task. You can learn more about Python and its functionality here (https://www.python.org/).\n","\n","Not every tool that you might want is provided by Python, however. For example, Python doesn't come with functionality for constructing and displaying a graph. It also doesn't provide definitions for a large number of mathematical functions, it doesn't provide a way to generate (psuedo)-random numbers, and it doesn't give you default capability to browse the web.\n","\n","A lot of times, though, someone else has already written code that will allow you to do these things.
